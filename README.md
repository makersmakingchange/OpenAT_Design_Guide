# Open Assistive Technology (OpenAT) Design Resources

**OpenAT (Open-Source Assistive Technology)** refers to assistive devices whose designs are publicly shared, allowing anyone to study, modify, make, and improve them. OpenAT projects are typically co-created by people with disabilities, engineers, makers, and disability professionals. Because the designs are open, these technologies can be adapted to individual needs, built at lower cost, and improved by a global community, increasing accessibility for everyone.

The **OpenAT Design Guide** is intended to be an ever-growing collection of resources and best practises for designing OpenAT that is easy to build, adapt, use, and improve upon. The guide includes information on Design for 3D Printing, as well as details on many of the design elements and common commercial components used by Makers Making Change.

This guide is a living document, and is intended to be changed and updates as better measurements and methods are discovered. If you have an improvement or a section that should be added, you are welcome to contribute to the guide.

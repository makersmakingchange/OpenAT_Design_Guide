# Open Assistive Technology (OpenAT) Design Resources

The OpenAT Design Guide is a collection of the CAD and 3D printing best practices used by the Makers Making Change team while designing OpenAT devices. The guide includes information on general 3D printing design tips, how to design around the common commercial components used by Makers Making Change, and how to design the common 3D printed features added to Makers Making Change devices.

This guide is a living document, and is intended to be changed and updates as better measurements and methods are discovered. If you have an improvement or a section that should be added, you are welcome to contribute to the guide.

## How to improve this Design Guide
As open source documentation, you are welcomed and encouraged to improve upon the Design Guide. Information on how to contribute can be found [here](https://makersmakingchange.github.io/OpenAT_Design_Guide/How-To-Contribute.html)
